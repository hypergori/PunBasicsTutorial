# PunBasicsTutorial
This is the Unity project which implemented the PUN(Photon Unity Network) Basics Tutorial.
The URL of the tutorial is , 

http://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/current/tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/intro

This is good tutorial to learn

1. Setup PUN application ID and Project setup with asset store
1. Lobby and Room with Launcer Scene
1. Master Client and Scene Synchronizaton
1. Networked Instantiation and Resouces folder 
1. PhotonView and Auto-Synchronization of Transform/Animation
1. Manual synchronization using IPUNObservable
1. PUN Callbacks when new players join

But, As of today(29Sep2016), this tutorial has some issues like using deprecated Unity api and missing/wrong instructions.
I mangaged to find the solution and finally it works now. and I publish this here.
